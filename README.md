# Yeast Protein Localization — Machine Learning Project

Predicting the subcellular localization of yeast proteins using supervised machine learning.  
This project builds and evaluates classifiers on the **Yeast dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, focusing on handling **class imbalance**, assessing **model performance**, and supporting **biological feature interpretation**.

## Overview

- **Goal**: Predict the localization site of a protein (10 possible classes) based on 8 numeric biological features  
- **Domain**: Bioinformatics + Machine Learning  
- **Type of task**: Supervised, multi-class classification  
- **Challenge**: Highly imbalanced classes, overlapping features  
- **Key focus**: Robust evaluation (F1-score, ROC/PR curves), model optimization, interpretability

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Yeast Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Yeast)  
- **Samples**: 1,484 yeast proteins  
- **Features**: 8 numerical descriptors (e.g. signal sequence score, hydrophobicity)  
- **Target**: Subcellular localization (10 classes: CYT, NUC, MIT, POX, EXC, VAC, ERL, etc.)

---

## Pipeline

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Class distribution, feature correlation, imbalance analysis  
2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Label encoding, feature scaling (StandardScaler), stratified train/test split  
   - SMOTE oversampling on underrepresented classes  
3. **Model Training & Optimization**  
   - Random Forest (baseline)  
   - Random Forest with `class_weight="balanced"`  
   - SMOTE-based training  
   - GridSearchCV tuning (`n_estimators`, `max_depth`)  
4. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, macro & weighted F1-scores  
   - Per-class precision & recall  
   - Confusion matrix heatmaps  
   - ROC and Precision-Recall curves (1-vs-rest)  
   - Feature importance analysis (bar plot)

## Models

The following models are trained and compared:

- **Baseline Random Forest**  
- **Random Forest with class weights** (`class_weight="balanced"`)  
- **Random Forest on SMOTE-balanced data**  
- **GridSearchCV-optimized Random Forest**

### Evaluation metrics:

- **Accuracy**  
- **Macro / weighted F1-score**  
- **Confusion matrix (multiclass)**  
- **ROC AUC and Precision-Recall curves** (top 3 classes)

---

## Task

- **Input**: 8 numerical features per protein  
- **Output**: One of 10 subcellular localization labels  
- **Evaluation strategy**:  
  - Train/test split (80/20, stratified)  
  - Macro-averaged metrics for class imbalance  
  - Model selection based on GridSearchCV scoring (`f1_macro`)  
  - Feature importance and interpretability

---

## Optional Extensions

To enhance analysis and model understanding:

- **Post-hoc error analysis**:  
  Identify confused class pairs (e.g., MIT vs CYT) using the confusion matrix  
  > Example: "Are mitochondrial proteins misclassified due to overlapping signal scores?"

- **Feature importance visualization**:  
  Extract and rank features using `feature_importances_` from Random Forest  

- **Dimensionality reduction** (optional):  
  Use PCA or t-SNE to visualize class clusters in 2D
